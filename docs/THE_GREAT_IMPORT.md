our_import:
  command: "dbbasic import --from-rails ./their_app"
  time: "3 seconds"
  result: "47 lines of config"
  performance: "1000x faster"
  their_reaction: "Wait... what?"
```

## The Conversation

### Before Import
```
CTO: "We have 5 million lines of code"
DBBasic: "Import it"
CTO: "You don't understand, it's complex"
DBBasic: "Import it"
CTO: "It has business logic spanning 500 files"
DBBasic: "Import it"
CTO: "It took us 5 years to build"
DBBasic: "Import it"
```

### After Import (3 seconds later)
```
CTO: "It's... 50 lines?"
DBBasic: "Yes"
CTO: "And it works?"
DBBasic: "Better. 1000x faster"
CTO: "What were we doing for 5 years?"

## What The Import Actually Does

### Step 1: Read Everything
```python
# Reads 500,000 lines of code
# Like an archeologist examining ruins
```

### Step 2: Find The Truth
```python
# Discovers 98% is framework nonsense
# 2% is actual business logic
```

### Step 3: Extract The Essence
```python
# Takes the 2% that matters
# Converts to config
```

### Step 4: Enhance
```python
# Adds 402M rows/sec performance
# Adds real-time capabilities
# Adds AI services
```

## The Support Tickets

### Ticket #1
```
Subject: Import tool broken?
Body: It only generated 50 lines. Our app is 500,000 lines.
Response: Working as intended. The other 499,950 lines were unnecessary.
Status: Closed - User education needed
```

### Ticket #2
```
Subject: Where did my code go?
Body: I spent 5 years writing that code!
Response: It's all there, just expressed efficiently now.
Status: Closed - Therapy recommended
```

### Ticket #3
```
Subject: This can't be right
Body: Our enterprise system is now 73 lines?
Response: Correct. It always was. You just had 499,927 extra lines.
Status: Closed - Truth hurts
```

## The Marketing Campaign

### Billboard #1
"Your 500,000 line app in 50 lines.
Same features. 1000x faster.
`dbbasic import`"

We'll make them fast."

## The Philosophical Question

If your entire enterprise system can be expressed in 100 lines of config...

What were you doing for the last decade?

## The Ultimate Flex

```bash
$ dbbasic import --from-company google

Analyzing all of Google's services...
Reducing complexity...
Removing duplicates...
Optimizing...

Generated: google.dbbasic (10,000 lines)

Note: YouTube is line 4,235
Note: Gmail is lines 100-150
Note: Search is lines 1-50

P.S. - This now runs on a laptop
```
