# DBBasic SOA Implementation Status

## Overview
DBBasic has successfully implemented a complete Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with event sourcing capabilities. The system is operational with all core services running and accessible.

## Architecture Components

### ðŸŸ¢ Active Services

| Port | Service | Status | Description |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 8000 | Main Portal | âœ… Running | Static site with dashboard and controls |
| 8001 | Config Editor | âœ… Running | Web-based configuration management |
| 8002 | Site Generator | âœ… Running | Dynamic website generation from config |
| 8003 | AI Service Builder | âœ… Running | AI-powered service generation |
| 8004 | Realtime Monitor | âœ… Running | WebSocket-based real-time monitoring |
| 8005 | CRUD Engine | âœ… Running | Config-driven CRUD operations |
| 8006 | Test Runner | âœ… Running | Web-based test execution interface |
| 8007 | Event Store | âœ… Running | Event sourcing and history tracking |
| 8010 | Auth Service | âœ… Running | JWT-based authentication and user management |

## Key Features

### Event Sourcing (Port 8007)
- **Immutable Event Store**: All changes are recorded as events
- **Event History**: Complete audit trail of all system changes
- **Projections**: Materialized views for query optimization
- **Snapshots**: Performance optimization for aggregate rebuilding

### CRUD Engine (Port 8005)
- **Config-Driven**: Define entities in YAML/JSON
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data
- **HTTP Fallback**: Reliable data loading with fallback mechanisms
- **Customer Management**: Fully operational with "Dan" and other test data visible

### AI Service Builder (Port 8003)
- **Natural Language to API**: Generate services from descriptions
- **Black Box Services**: No code writing required
- **Available Endpoints**:
  - `/ai/calculate_order_total`
  - `/ai/send_order_confirmation`
  - `/ai/recalculate_customer_segment`
  - `/ai/detect_fraud`
  - `/ai/optimize_prices`

### Auth Service (Port 8010)
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **User Management**: Registration, login, logout, password change
- **Session Management**: Token validation and revocation
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin and regular user roles
- **Clean Separation**: Completely independent from other services
- **DuckDB Storage**: User credentials and sessions stored securely

### Realtime Monitor (Port 8004)
- **WebSocket Connections**: Live system monitoring
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time event visualization
- **System Metrics**: Performance and health monitoring

## Test Organization

```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/          # Unit tests for individual components
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/   # Integration tests for service interactions
â””â”€â”€ e2e/          # End-to-end tests with Selenium
```

## Database Layer
- **DuckDB**: High-performance analytical database
- **WAL Mode**: Write-ahead logging for consistency
- **Event Storage**: Append-only event log
- **Projections**: Materialized views for queries

## Philosophy
> "Config defines structure. AI implements logic. No code written."

This represents a paradigm shift in software development where:
1. Configuration drives the entire system
2. AI handles implementation details
3. Developers focus on business logic, not code
4. Event sourcing provides complete history and traceability

## Access Points

- Main Dashboard: http://localhost:8000
- Config Editor: http://localhost:8001
- AI Services: http://localhost:8003
- Realtime Monitor: http://localhost:8004
- CRUD Interface: http://localhost:8005/customers
- Test Runner: http://localhost:8006
- Event Store API: http://localhost:8007/events
- Auth Service: http://localhost:8010

## Status Summary

âœ… **FULL SOA ACHIEVED** - All services operational and integrated

The DBBasic SOA vision is now reality: a fully event-sourced, config-driven, AI-powered service architecture where every change is tracked, every service is discoverable, and the system evolves through configuration rather than code.
